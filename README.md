# hello-world
Hello, I am Jonathan and toying with GitHub. My studies previously focused on fiction and language, completing two masters in Comparative Literature and Linguistics. Today I have made a start with making my own versioning system. I already knew about this project from Textpattern, an open source blogging system, but have never made the plunge of creating my own account.
